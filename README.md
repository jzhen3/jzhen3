### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜€ I am Jinsong Zhen

- ðŸ”­ As a Data Scientist intern at a capital sales consulting company in the past 6 months, I researched on random forest proximities algorithms for outlier detection & missing-value imputation tools and testing the downstream model performance with different evaluation metrics.
- Side project: PDF text extraction project with Deep Learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently conducting large language model projects and helping to write Random Forest Proximity Paper.
- ðŸ‘¯ With my academic background and working experience in data analysis, I am equipped with the capabilities of data visualization, statistical analysis, data mining, geospatial data modeling, statistical modeling, predictive modeling, machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and programming languages to leverage cutting-edge technologies for transforming complex & big datasets into valuable data insights.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Growing up since 12, I've always been a distance runner. I won city championships in middle-distance running events before moving to the United States. On my high school track team, I broke my record in an individual 5000m race and finished 5th at the NYC Public Schoolâ€™s Cross-Country Championships. I can play piano by ear and improvise as if I were at a tiny desk concert, or sight read for fun thanks to my Cantonese Piano Association certification. For now, I've discovered a passion for photography and travel.
