- âš¡ Fun fact: Growing up since 12, I've always been a distance runner. I won city championships in middle-distance running events before moving to the United States. On the high school track team, I broke my record in an individual 5000m race and finished 5th at the NYC Public Schoolâ€™s Cross-Country Championships, representing my school. I can play piano by ear and improvise as if I were at a tiny desk concert, or sight read for fun thanks to my Cantonese Piano Association certification. For now, I've discovered a passion for photography and travel.
